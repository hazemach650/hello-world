#Idea 1: kohlrabi krunch

You're a gopher trying to eat the farm's kohlrabi before the farmers harvest. Along the way you have to avoid gopher snakes. 

The kohlrabi grows over time. Keep track with a variable. After a certain point, human walks over to pick up kohlrabi. 
If he touches, it's his. If you (gopher) touches, it's yours.
