# ideas for final project

First idea: app that tells people when to take their medicine. 
They input n times in the day for medicine, at which time alarm goes off. 
Each medicine-input consists of various identifying characteristics, and a collection of numbers between 1,...,n which signify the times to take that medicine. 
When alarm goes, they can snooze it. After which, check boxes appear next to all the medicines they have to take. Once they check off all the boxes, the alarm turns off. They can check off the boxes before the alarm goes off as well.
